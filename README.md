# Shellshock-io-source
Source code to Shellshock.io

### About
Currently, the source for the game `shellshock.io` is obfuscated. I am working on de-obfuscating the entire file. You can use this source to inject what you want, and even modify the source and use an extension like `Requestly` (link below) to substitute the script with your own to essentially "hack it."
